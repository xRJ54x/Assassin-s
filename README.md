This is a very early idea of an Android Application. It uses basic Http requests and the timing of the packets from source to destination
is used to determine who your target is. You are given a target when you first open the app, it is the users job to find and "eliminate"
the target. When you find the target, you shake your phone in the direction of the person and it pings multiple times and establishes
a connection with that person. A 6 byte hex code is sent from the target to the source phone. A notification pops up on the senders phone
and a new target is given.
